Welcome to Cactus's documentation!
==================================

Einstein Toolkit is composed of several different modules and is developed by researchers from different institutions throughout the world. Documentation for several modules is very brief. 

I decided to write this documentation. One goal is to make Cactus easy for beginners to understand and modify, with minimal effort.

This documentation provided a useful guide for the parameter file and thorn writing.
