EinsteinBase
===============
EinsteinBase thorns define and register basic variables within numerical relativity.





CoordGauge
-----------
Base thorn to provide the infrastructure for dynamic gauge selection.


ADMMacros
----------
This thorn provides various macros which can be used to calculate quantities, such as the Christoffel Symbol or Riemann Tensor components, using the basic variables of thorn ADMBase.

ADMCoupling
-------------
This avoids explicit dependencies between the spacetime and matter evolution thorns.
