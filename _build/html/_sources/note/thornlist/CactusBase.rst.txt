CactusBase
============================
Coordinate
------------
The CoordBase thorn provides a method of registering coordinate systems and their properties.

CoordBase provides a way for specifying the extent of the simulation domain that is independent of the actual coordinate and symmetry thorns. This is necessary because the size of the physical domain is not necessarily the same as the size of the computational grid, which is usually enlarged by symmetry zones and/or boundary zones.

Boundary
----------------
Provides a generic interface to boundary conditions, and provides a set of standard boundary conditions for one, two, and three dimensional grid variables.

.. digraph:: foo

   "Boundary" -> "SymBase";

Warning
^^^^^^^^^^
* The aliased function 'SymmetryTableHandleForGrid' (required by thorn 'Boundary') has not been provided by any active thorn !

    >>> ActiveThorns = "SymBase"

IOUtil
-----------
Thorns providing IO methods typically have string parameters which list the variables which should be output, how frequently (i.e. how many iterations between output), and where the output should go.

.. digraph:: foo

    "IOUtil" -> "CarpetSlab";
    "IOUtil" -> "PUGHSlab";

Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^
* The name of the directory to be used for output.

    >>> IO::out_dir = $parfile

* How often, in terms of iterations, each of the Cactus I/O methods will write output.

    >>> IO::out_every = 2
    ------------------------------
    it |          | *::coarse_dx |
       |    t     | scalar value |
    ------------------------------
     0 |    0.000 |   0.25000000 |
     2 |    2.000 |   0.25000000 |
     4 |    4.000 |   0.25000000 |
     6 |    6.000 |   0.25000000 |
     8 |    8.000 |   0.25000000 |

Warning
^^^^^^^^^^
* No driver thorn activated to provide storage for variables

    >>> ActiveThorns = "CarpetSlab"
    AMR driver provided by Carpet
    >>> ActiveThorns = "PUGHSlab"
    Driver provided by PUGH


IOBasic
-----------
Thorn IOBasic provides I/O methods for outputting scalar values in ASCII format into files and for printing them as runtime information to screen.

* This method outputs the information into ASCII files named "<scalar_name>.{asc|xg}" (for CCTK_SCALAR variables) and "<var_name>_<reduction>.{asc|xg}" (for CCTK_GF and CCTK_ARRAY variables where reduction would stand for the type of reduction operations (eg. minimum, maximum, L1, and L2 norm)
* This method prints the data as runtime information to stdout. The output occurs as a table with columns containing the current iteration number, the physical time at this iteration, and more columns for scalar/reduction values of each variable to be output.

Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^
* Print the information of CCTK_SCALAR variables

    >>> IOBasic::outInfo_vars = "grid::coarse_dx"
    -------------------------------
    it  |          | *::coarse_dx |
        |    t     | scalar value |
    -------------------------------
      0 |    0.000 |   0.25000000 |

* Print the information of CCTK_GF and CCTK_ARRAY variables with the type of reduction

    >>> IOBasic::outInfo_vars = "thorn::var"  
    >>> IOBasic::outInfo_reductions = "minimum maximum"
    ________
    >>> IOBasic::outInfo_vars = "thorn::var{reductions = 'norm2'}"  

.. todo:: Write this section.

* Outputs CCTK_SCALAR variabless into ASCII files

    >>> IOBasic::outScalar_vars = "grid::coarse_dx"

IOASCII
------------
Thorn IOASCII provides I/O methods for 1D, 2D, and 3D output of grid arrays and grid functions into files in ASCII format.

Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^
* Outputs CCTK_GF and CCTK_ARRAY variables into ASCII files

    >>> IOASCII::out1D_every = 1 
    >>> IOASCII::out1D_style = "gnuplot f(x)"
    >>> IOASCII::out1D_vars = "thorn::var"

.. todo:: Write this section.

Time
-------
Calculates the timestep used for an evolution

.. todo:: Write this section.

SymBase
----------
Thorn SymBase provides a mechanism by which symmetry conditions can register routines that handle this mapping when a global interpolator is called.


Slab
-------
Slab can be used to apply symmetry or periodicity boundary conditions, or to collect data onto a single processor to process it more easily.


InitBase
----------
Thorn InitBase speciﬁs how initial data are to be set up.

Fortran
----------------
This thorn provides Fortran interfaces for the ﬂesh functions.
