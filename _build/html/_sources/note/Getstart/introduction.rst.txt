Introduction
=============
The largest user base for Cactus is in the field of numerical relativity where, for example, over 100 components are now shared among over fifteen different groups through the `Einstein Toolkit <http://einsteintoolkit.org/index.html>`_.

Cactus is a component framework. Its components are called thorns whereas the framework itself is called the flesh. The flesh is the core of Cactus, it provides the APIs for thorns to communicate with each other, and performs a number of administrative tasks at build–time and run–time.

.. note::

    The Cactus API supports C/C++ and F77/F90 programming languages for the thorns. This makes it easier for scientists to turn existing codes into thorns which can then make use of the complete Cactus infrastructure, and in turn be used by other thorns within Cactus.

Flesh
-------
At run-time the flesh parses a user provided parameter file which defines which thorns are required and provides key-value pairs of parameter assignments. The flesh then activates only the required thorns, sets the given parameters, using default values for parameters which are not specified in the parameter file, and creates the schedule of which functions provided by the activated thorns to run at which time.
