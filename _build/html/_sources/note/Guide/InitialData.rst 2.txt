Seed_Magnetic_Fields
---------------------
This formulation assumes that :math:`A_r` and :math:`A_\theta = 0`; only :math:`A_\phi` can be nonzero. The following sets up a vector potential of the form

.. math::
    
    A_\phi = \varpi^2 A_b max[(EE-EE_{cut}),0],

where :math:`\varpi` is the cylindrical radius: :math:`\sqrt{x^2+y^2}`,and :math:`EE \in \{\rho, P\}` is the variable P or :math:`\rho` specifying whether the vector potential is proportional to P or :math:`\rho` in the region greater than the cutoff.

Parameter
^^^^^^^^^^
* A-field prescription

    >>> Seed_Magnetic_Fields::Afield_type = "Pressure_prescription"

* Multiply A_phi by varpi^2?

    >>> Seed_Magnetic_Fields::enable_varpi_squared_multiplication = yes

* Magnetic field strength parameter.

    >>> Seed_Magnetic_Fields::A_b = 1e-3

* Cutoff pressure, below which vector potential is set to zero. Typically set to 4% of the maximum initial pressure.

    >>> Seed_Magnetic_Fields::P_cut

* Cutoff density, below which vector potential is set to zero. Typically set to 20% of the maximum initial density.
