The Source File
================

By default, the CCTK looks in the ``src`` directory of the thorn for source files.

The Cactus make system looks for a file called ``make.code.defn`` in that directory (if there is no file called ``Makefile`` in the ``src`` directory). At its simplest, this file contains two lines

.. code-block:: bash

    SRCS = <list of all source files in this directory>
    SUBDIRS = <list of all subdirectories, including subdirectories of subdirectories>

Each subdirectory listed should then have a ``make.code.defn`` file containing just a ``SRCS =`` line, a ``SUBDIRS =`` line will be ignored.
