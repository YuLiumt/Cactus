Naming Conventions:

* Thorn names must not start with the word "Cactus" (in any case). 
* Routine names have to be unique among all thorns. 
* Names of global variables have to be unique among all thorns.

The following naming conventions are followed by the flesh and the supported Cactus arrangements. They are not compulsory.

* Parameters: lower case with words separated by an underscore. Examples: my_first_parameter.
* Routine names and names of global variables: Prefixed by thorn name with an underscore, then capitalised words, with no spaces. Examples: MyThorn_StartUpRoutine.
