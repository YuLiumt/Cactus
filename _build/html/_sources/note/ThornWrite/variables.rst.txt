Cactus Variables
=================

Cactus variables are used instead of local variables for a number of reasons:

* Cactus variables can be made visible to other thorns, allowing thorns to communicate and share data.
* Cactus variables can be distributed and communicated among processors, allowing parallel computation.
* A database of Cactus variables, and their attributes, is held by the flesh, and this information is used by thorns, for example, for obtaining a list of variables for checkpointing.

Cactus variables are collected into groups. All variables in a group are of the same data type, and have the same attributes. Most Cactus operations act on a group as a whole. A group must be declared in its thornâ€™s ``interface.ccl`` file.

.. code-block:: bash

    <data_type> <group_name> [TYPE=<group_type>] [DIM=<dim>] [TIMELEVELS=<num>] [SIZE=<size in each direction>] [DISTRIB=<distribution_type>] [GHOSTSIZE=<ghostsize>]
    [{
    [<variable_name>, <variable_name>, <variable_name> ]
    } ["<group_description>"]]

Currently, the names of groups and variables must be distinct.
