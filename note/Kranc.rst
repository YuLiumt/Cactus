Kranc
======

Kranc produces a complete Cactus thorn including the configuration files. 
In addition there are routines to define Cactus parameters.

Kranc interfaces with MoL and one of itâ€™s main functions is to produce the RHS evaluation routine for the evolution equations.

The user has to use Kranc mathematica routines to define tensors and their properties and how they relate to the Cactus grid functions.
